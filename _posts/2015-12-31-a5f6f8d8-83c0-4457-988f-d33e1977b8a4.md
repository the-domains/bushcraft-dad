The point of being in the woods is not to become comfortable.

It is to practice active engagement with a world that is arbitrary, distal, and dynamic. 

A laboratory for engaged experience.
Comfortable is hiding in your house. Alive and responsive is a natural state. This state exists as an expanded sense of self. Expanded and sensitive. Wary and alert. This is the opposite of the cocoon of protections that we have at home. A city bathed in light. In the city a neighborhood of like-minded people. With auto and home insurance. A home with the doors locked, the porch lights on, and an alarm system at the ready. Inside the home a bedroom with the door locked and the heater turned on. In the bedroom a warm bed with the blankets pulled up around your neck and you can just phase out and float off to never-never land.
Regular and on-purpose exposure of the physical and emotional self is a way to freedom and expansiveness. Walking into cold water. Hiking in the dark woods away from all society. These invite you to manage without the securities. The management involves an active dissolution of the boundaries of identity to the surface of your skin. An active re-identification with a wider frame of reference. Reaching the sense of "I" out to a wide sweep of woods and trail allows sensitivity and awareness. Reaching out the sense of I away from the sensitive barrier of skin and bracingly cold water and into the wider reaches around you makes the life-pulling cold a known fact of your moment in time, and not the focus of a need to escape and run back inside.
